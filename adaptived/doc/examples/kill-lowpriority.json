			"description": "This configuration was motivated by Meta's oomd daemon.  By placing important processes in a cgroup, say highpriority.scope, adaptived can ensure that these processes get utmost priority when there is additional load on the machine.  In this example, adaptived kills processes in the low-priority cgroup until the pressure abates.  Note that unlike oomd, adaptived can operated on memory, cpu, or io PSI pressure (or some other measurement entirely) and not just memory",
